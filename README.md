# To-Supply-Leftover-Food-To-Poor
The "To Supply Leftover Food to Poor" project, facilitated through the Food Connect app on Salesforce, aims to reduce food waste and alleviate hunger. This initiative involves managing venues with surplus food, coordinating tasks and volunteer efforts, and establishing drop-off points for redistribution. Custom objects in Salesforce track venues, tasks, volunteers, and drop-off points, ensuring efficient food collection and distribution. The project fosters better coordination and effective resource allocation, contributing to a more structured and impactful approach to feeding the underprivileged, thereby addressing both food waste and hunger in our communities.
